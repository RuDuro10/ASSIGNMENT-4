# The Purpose of a .gitignore file 

A ***.gitignore*** file is a text file used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored by version control. 
It helps keep your repository clean and focused by excluding files like temporary files, compiled binaries, 
and sensitive configuration files from being tracked. By preventing unnecessary changes and clutter in your commit history,
it improves collaboration and ensures consistency across team members. Additionally, it enhances security by protecting sensitive 
information such as API keys and credentials from being accidentally committed and shared publicly.
